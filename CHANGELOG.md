# 0.2.0

* Removed the `meta_args` argument to `memory_plot`, and replaced it with `targets_metadata`. This should be more user friendly and also flexible than the previous API
* `memory_plot` now takes the input from `summarise_targets`
* Added various functions that may be useful to end users:
  * `process_meta`
  * `profile_per_target`
  * `summarise_targets`
